1] Package naming conventions should be corrected as com.indium.bankingapp -> com.indium.bankingapp.model -> com.indium.bankingapp.service
2] AccountService Interface and Implemention naming conventions are not appropriate. AccountService -> AccountServiceArrImpl
3] [AccountService] createAccount and updateAccount should receive Account object instead seperate account values
